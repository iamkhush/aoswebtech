			<h3>Minyadi</h3>
			<p>Minyadi is an e-commerce platform for sell handmade arts and crafts. It has an EBay style, meaning, users can sell and buy products at the same time. They can build their own shops and sell their own craft. Its a work in progress, but do go over the app, and signup.
				</p>
			<p>
			We helped setup Payment gateway for this web app, fixed up many user flow issues. One of the major issues was related to server costs and management. We reduced the cost and headaches by hosting the app on Heroku.
