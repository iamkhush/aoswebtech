			<h3>Seed The Change</h3>
			<p>Seed The Change exists to help small businesses make a difference in the world by helping them plant trees as they grow.

			Seedthechange was initially a PHP application. We migrated it to Python, Django framework. Along with it migrated Mysql to Postgres db and moved to Heroku platform. Moreover, we helped them move over to several E-commerce platforms like Bigcommerce and Shopify by building an api for their clients.
